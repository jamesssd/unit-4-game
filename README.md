# unit-4-game

In this unit, we are challenged to try to replicate the Crystal Collector game. We are provided with the knowledge of Javascript, jQuery, HTML and CSS to do this game. 

With the Crystal Collector Game, the user is give a random number anywhere from 19 to 120 and the user must try to match the random number with the hidden random numbers in the Crystal. If the user successfully match the random number given by the computer, then the user wins. If the user fails to match the random number, then the user loses that round.

Complications:
-The complications I had with this game is the attaching the crystal images in its assigned place.
-I also tried putting a reset button so that the user can just click reset and the game will reset itself rather than refreshing the whole page. But I could not figure out how to make it work so I gave up on that one.

Shoutout:
-I would like to thank Google for helping me find my crystal images.
-Thank you YouTube for being a sample of somewhat related to the Crystal Collectiom Game.
